Text    : 
  
  An important benefit of ALDMG it that it does not does 
  require the user of the library to keep track of the state of the individual 
  widgets. Only a global GUI state needs to be created and destroyed. 
  
  Furthermore, the communication between the GUI and the program that uses
  the program happens though widget functions, and not through callbacks. 
  
  Only in the case of custom widgets, calbacks are used for the operation of the 
  widget, but the communication between widget and GUI still happens though 
  a widget function.

Text    : 
  
  ALDMG supports many widgets, with the onus on widgets that are actually useful
  for the GUI of a game, as opposed to generic widgets.

Requirement : GUI Library
ID          : REQ_1
Topic       : ALDMG
Status      : TODO
Description : 
  
  ALDMG is a programming library. ALDMG implements Graphical User Interface 
  functionality. 
  
-----------

Requirement : C Library
ID          : REQ_1.1
Parent      : GUI Library
Status      : TODO
Description : ALDMG is implemented in plain C. The C89 standard is followed.
Rationale   : This makes ALDMG easier to use from other (scripting) languages.

-----------

Requirement : Allegro 5.1
ID          : REQ_1.2
Parent      : GUI Library
Status      : TODO
Description : ALDMG requires Allegro 5.1 or better.
Rationale   : 
  
  ALDMG is specifically intended for use in multimedia applications. 
  Allegro is a great cross-platform multimedia library. 
  Hence, ALDMG will use Allegro for all graphical operations.
  Allegro 5.1 or better is required because it has support for better polygon
  and text drawing.

Requirement : State Management
ID          : REQ_2
Topic       : State
Description : 
  
  ALDMG manages the state of the widgets internally. The user of the library
  does not have to keep track of the widgets directly. The user of the library
  only has to keep track of an instance of the state of the whole GUI.
  
Rationale   : 
  
  Most GUI libraries require the user to keep track of all widgets. This is 
  annoying, verbose, and error-prone. ALDMG tries to improve on this by 
  moving all widgets into a single opaque GUI state.
